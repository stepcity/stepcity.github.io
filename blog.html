				<p>I suppose that it's because I've been hacking together an emulator that I'm thinking about memory. No, not your computer's memory - real memory, the grand consciousness.</p>
				<p>Memory can, I think, be considered the ultimate backdrop to existence.</p>
				<p>The saying goes, "If a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, did it really fall?" It could probably be more obtusely said, "If a tree fell in the forest and nobody remembers it, did it really fall?"</p>
				<p>Obviously, you can go to the forest and find the fallen beast and speculate - "mayhaps this tree did fall, many years ago?" But you can never really know the story unless you remember it.</p>

			<div class="content">
				<p>"Why are you telling us this?" I metaphorically hear you ask.</p>
				<p>I say all this because in this literal pandemic, where I am locked indoors to dwell with my own thoughts, I'm having a realization that there is a metaphorical pandemic of forgetting. In an era where everything is connected together, where every piece of datum is logged by some international corporation, and where I can instantly find out every detail about what was happening at 11:39:13 PM on January 28, 1986, the world is slowly being forgotten.</p>
				<p>You might be thinking, "We're not forgetting everything! I know lots of things, I'm very cultured and I do lots of cultured-people things!" Well sit down, you pasteurized fuck, and listen to what I've got to say.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>I don't think that it's possible to outright forget something - to simply erase it from the consciousness of the entire world, all at once, preventing it from ever taking root again. No, that would never work, and anyways, it doesn't need to. There's a better way, and it's already happening.</p>
				<p>Suppose you have a text file on your computer, and you want to send it to your friend's computer. Sure, hook it up! Send it over, and: BOOM! One new file on your pal's computer. But wait - looks like the file sharing protocol was a little faulty, every couple bytes are a little wrong. No biggie, your friend can just replace them with what makes sense for him! Everything's all fine and dandy, right?</p>
				<p>Right, until your friend sends the file to the next person, and the next person, and so on. It's like telephone - as it goes, it accumulates errors, till at the end of the chain, the file's nothing like the original. But that's not the insidious part. What makes me absolutely <span style="font-style: italic">terrified</span> of this is that at the end of the chain, the file says it's the same file. The difference is in the contents. The end and the beginning think they have the same thing, and yet they have entirely different files.</p>
				<p>This phenomenon is the most foolproof way to forget something: Start with an idea, replace the idea, and destroy any notion of which idea came first. Once it's impossible to tell which idea is original, it's trivial for the new idea to become canon, and for supporters of your idea to revile the original as a fake, a hoax.</p>

				<p>I've found so many examples of this that it's not even fun for me to write about, but I feel so disgusted by this that I must.</p>
				<p>One of the most well known examples, perhaps, is Caramelldansen. An insanely popular meme that took the world by storm in 2008-2009, this song was practically sculpted from an original piece of work into a cash cow for the Caramella Girls. The worst part? The internet rediscovered the song in 2020, and (generally) gave all credit to the Caramella Girls rather than the true creator, Caramell.</p>
				<p>The internet as a whole seems to think that the Caramella Girls were musical geniuses for coming up with Caramelldansen and... it feels so wrong. It's converting a cultural icon into, well, still a cultural icon, but it's not the same.</p>
				<p>Or how about the recent craze in "retro" (ugh) technology? My generation found out about all of these old computers and they're so "cool" and "aesthetic", wow! Except they're not actually interested in the computers (or even the appearance of the computers), they're interested in the appearance of the computers as sold to them by TikTok (TM), Instagram (TM), SnapChat (TM), Discord (TM), Reddit (TM), and so on...</p>
				<p>My point here is that none of these crazes in remembering the past actually remember the past. They're remembering what the corporations can sell them, and it's never really the past - no, it's a plastic recreation that can be packaged and sold with advertisements.</p>
				<p>Those aren't the only examples, though. Kanye West (and an entirely new generation of TikTok addicts) replacing "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger", Microsoft (and an entirely new generation of Minecraft Bedrock Edition players) pretending that Minecraft Bedrock Edition is Minecraft and that Minecraft is Minecraft Java Edition, and so on. Everything vulnerable is bought out, relabeled, and resold <span style="font-style: italic">just</span> similar enough to pass to the market, leaving behind an empty, emotionless husk of a memory.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Sure, I realize that I come off as a dick weasel who can't "get with the times" or stop focusing so much on this stuff. But what's the point in that? Are we to just roll over and let <span style="font-style: italic">our</span> pasts be resold to us? Are we to just pretend that this is what it's supposed to be like, and that this is how it is?</p>
				<p>Sure, I realize that I'm doing exactly what I complain about - I'm writing modern HTML (a corrupt memory of HTML) on Windows (do I even have to say it?) to store on GitHub (a corrupt memory of Git). But that's exactly the problem - we aren't being given a choice as to what we remember. The bad people aren't the consumers, they're the corporations who're selling us a dream and locking us in to their vision.</p>
				<p>I understand that it's hard to fight back. Hell, that terrifies me, too, how I can't stop any of this. That's a topic for another post, though. My point in writing this is that if it's possible to spread an idea a second time, it's possible to spread it a first time. So here I am, writing down my idea. Maybe it'll plant an idea in someone's head and grow into something bigger... or maybe it'll be ignored. Whatever happens, please protect your local Data Archivist. They have good memories.</p>

				<p>Regions are a data structure used in the Macintosh's QuickDraw that generate an irregular shape and then force graphics to only be drawn within said shape (like a clipping mask).</p>
				<p>The most obvious method of implementing this would be to create a bitmap the same size as your target with two values - on and off - and then XOR what you're drawing and the bitmap to get a clipped image. This has the obvious flaw, though, of duplicating data. If you've got a 100x100 image, then you're using 2000 pixels worth of data, which can be a real issue if you're trying to save memory.</p>
				<p>A more memory efficient method of this is to only keep track of the information you need. Because you've only got two values, you can think of every line of your region bitmap as a set of inversion points, which are X coordinates that toggle the coming pixels from off to on (or vice versa). From here, you only need to keep track of the inversion points. If your region is made up of very regular shapes, then this can save a lot of horizontal space.</p>
				<p>Then, you can group each set of inversion points by their Y coordinates. By comparing each group to the group above it, you can determine if there are changes or if there are not. Then, all groups that don't change get discarded, leaving you with only the information you need to extrapolate the rest.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>As an example, here is a 16x16 bitmap.</p>
				<img src="blog_regions_1.png"></img>
				<p>In order to store this bitmap as a region, the first thing that needs to be done is determine the inversion points - where we switch from a sequence of offs to a sequence of ons (we assume pixels are off by default).</p>
				<img src="blog_regions_2.png"></img>
				<p>Marked in red are the inversion points. Marked in green are the line endings.</p>
				<p>We then construct a list of inversion points, in the following arrangement:</p>
				<table>
					<tr><td>Y</td><td colspan=2>X</td><td>Line Ending</td></tr>
					<tr><td>00</td><td>05</td><td>11</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>01</td><td>03</td><td>13</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>02</td><td>02</td><td>14</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>03</td><td>01</td><td>15</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>04</td><td>01</td><td>15</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>05</td><td colspan=2>0</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>06</td><td colspan=2>0</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>07</td><td colspan=2>0</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>08</td><td colspan=2>0</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>09</td><td colspan=2>0</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>10</td><td colspan=2>0</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>11</td><td>01</td><td>15</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>12</td><td>01</td><td>15</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>13</td><td>02</td><td>14</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>14</td><td>03</td><td>13</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>15</td><td>05</td><td>11</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
				</table>
				<p>Note that each Y coordinate has multiple X coordinates - that is because there are multiple inversions per line. Also important to mention are that lines don't have a specified length; because they have only a definite start and end, their middle can be as long as required. This means that a line could theoretically expand to be the entirety of the usable memory if required.</p>
				<p>This information can be compressed even further by discarding duplicate rows, leaving us with the following:</p>
				<table>
					<tr><td>Y</td><td colspan=2>X</td><td>Line Ending</td></tr>
					<tr><td>00</td><td>05</td><td>11</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>01</td><td>03</td><td>13</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>02</td><td>02</td><td>14</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>03</td><td>01</td><td>15</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>05</td><td colspan=2>0</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>11</td><td>01</td><td>15</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>13</td><td>02</td><td>14</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>14</td><td>03</td><td>13</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
					<tr><td>15</td><td>05</td><td>11</td><td>EOL</td></tr>
				</table>
				<p>Obviously, on a real system, a region this small would be somewhat pointless because of the size of an INT being larger than the size of a plain bitmap. However, for large overlapping rectangular regions like what we'd see in a windowing system, this method can save a lot of space compared to a raw bitmap. On top of this, due to its nature of being built out of scan lines, it is extremely easy to hook this format of region into a Blit function that generates a mask for each line on the fly, meaning that it can be extremely performanct as well (as opposed to compression by, say, zlib).</p>
