				<p>Hi! If you're reading this, I'm assuming you're Saturn, since that's who I wrote this for. Otherwise, this'd be like, totally weird and kinda pointless to read.</p>
				<p>Anyways, this is a super totally official application to be a partner and whatnot. I'll detail why I'm cool and why you should like talk to me a bunch and stuff!</p>
				<p>For starters, I'm a guy. I'm 16 and into pretty much whatever I think is nice (like you). I live in California and I realize it's probably easier on you if I live close to you, but I'd be fine with anything (with the potential for visiting if you're far away!). Since there's not much room for me to go outside during this pandemic, I mostly spend my time playing Minecraft, messing with various artsy things, and thinking about miscellaneous computer-y things. However, I also spend a lot of time in nature! I'm a Scout and I help lead my local Troop. I also work at a scout camp over the summer and on occasional weekends teaching various nature things. I have really long hair, a weird mustache thing, and I'm built like a stick bug.</p>
				<p>It's probably relevant that if I were a social butterfly I wouldn't be writing this. However, the main reason I don't have many friends is because the people where I live are kinda lame. I'm 100% willing to be whatever you need, whether it's just a friend or if it's a partner (although I'm just as lonely and would love it if it's the latter ;). I can keep a conversation going about pretty much anything and I'm more than willing to take time out of whatever it is I'm doing to spend it with you.</p>

				<p>I'm assuming if I sent this to you somehow then I've already gotten some way to contact you. If not, then you can find me somewhere in this list!</p>
